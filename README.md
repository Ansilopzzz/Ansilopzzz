Hi, My name is @Ansil!
I'm 17 years old student studying in class 12.
I have created so many projects based on the Ddos flood attack bots.
My succesful projects are "Saphyra Ddos Attack Bot and the Hydra Ddos Attack Bot"
You can find the source codes for the ddos attack which are less effective and can be used to takedown small e-commerce or personal webpages.
If you need a very effective bot for taking down companies, then message me in whatsapp.
You can find the link in my profile. 
The hydra is available at IRS 1266/- which is both effective and available at less cost.
The Saphyra is the most powerfull one in my whole projects. It can take down companies.
